## Approach

The approach to solving these problems follows a structured pattern to ensure clarity and efficiency in both the solution and the explanation. For each problem:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Break down the problem statement to understand the requirements and edge cases.
   - Identify the optimal approach (whether to use Dynamic Programming, Recursion, Greedy Algorithms, or Graph Theory).

2. **Choosing the Right Algorithm**:
   - For problems involving subproblems with overlapping subproblems or optimal substructure, **Dynamic Programming** is used.
   - **Greedy Algorithms** are chosen when local optimal choices lead to a global optimum.
   - **Backtracking** or **Divide and Conquer** techniques are used for problems that require exploring multiple solutions.
   - **Graph Theory** techniques are applied where nodes and edges need to be explored.

3. **Code Implementation**:
   - A step-by-step implementation is provided in C++ using the chosen approach.
   - Code is structured for readability and ease of understanding.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test cases for each solution are included to verify the correctness of the implementation.
   - Edge cases and boundary conditions are considered.

5. **Time and Space Complexity Analysis**:
   - A detailed explanation of the time and space complexity of each solution.
   - The goal is to ensure that the solution is both time and space efficient.
